# Project
For Game Engine Dev.

// Basic Knowledge list

1. Computer Graphics
  This is significantly important than any other subjects. From now to 2027, I will study how computer graphics work behind the screen.
  And that goes without saying learning more than things taught in regular course.
 
2. Linear Algebra{
   Linear Algebra is fundamental thing of every part of CS/CSE. Also, in order to understand computer graphics it is imperative to consider
   this math as your life. 
}
   
4. Computer Architecture
   Computer Architecture is conerstone of everything I'll do in my career. This course is low-level oriented and will learn how computers
   operate.


What will I do for my FIRST project?

I'm not sure as of yet. However, once I learn what kind of challenges in computer graphics, that is my project.
I'm thinking just implementing basic game engine(physics + graphic)
